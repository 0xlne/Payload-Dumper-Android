Payload Dumper App for Android

## Currently app is working

### But i've not tested it completely
### #library compiled only for arm64 for now

>### May not extract some partition correctly

> Use extracted partition only for ref/study

> do not use it with real device not atleast for now


## # TODO
+ Save extracting thread after scrolling out of view
+ Add progress bar
+ Add hashing to check extracted images integrity
+ Add more architectures
+ Add support to extract from zip file (currently payload.bin only is supported)
